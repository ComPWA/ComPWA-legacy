Common Partial-Wave-Analysis Framework (ComPWA)
===============================================

.. warning:: **This C++ project is deprecated.** ComPWA has migrated to several
  Python projects and has become an organisation. Go to `compwa-org.rtfd.io
  <https://compwa-org.rtfd.io>`_ for an overview of the new projects.

Welcome to the class documentation of ComPWA!

These pages are useful if you are working on the C++ backend of the ComPWA
framework. See `the repository on GitHub <https://github.com/ComPWA/ComPWA-legacy>`_
for the source code.

ComPWA is best used through it's python interface (:py:mod:`pycompwa`). You can
find all installation instructions and usage examples on our website,
`compwa.github.io/pycompwa <https://compwa.github.io/pycompwa>`_.

.. note::
   The original Doxygen pages are still available and kept up-to-date at
   `compwa.github.io/ComPWA-legacy <https://compwa.github.io/ComPWA-legacy>`_.
