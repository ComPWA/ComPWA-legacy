Common Partial-Wave-Analysis Framework (ComPWA)
===============================================

Welcome to the class documentation of ComPWA!

These pages are useful if you are working on the C++ backend of the ComPWA
framework. See `the repository on GitHub <https://github.com/ComPWA/ComPWA>`_
for the source code.

ComPWA is best used through it's python interface (:py:mod:`pycompwa`). You can
find all installation instructions and usage examples on our website,
`compwa.github.io <https://compwa.github.io/>`_.

.. note::
   The original Doxygen pages are still available and kept up-to-date at
   `compwa.github.io/ComPWA <https://compwa.github.io/ComPWA/>`_.
